# Investigating-a-Movie-Dataset
The data set being investigated contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
Two questions was investigated:
> 1. Is the most popular movie each year the highest gross movie each year?
> 2. What is the coorelation between the highest gross movie and the maximum ratings of the genres?

From the first analysis, we are able to see that the being the most popular movie does not necessarily make it the highest gross movie and in futher analysis, 
the top gross movie was analysed with thier ratings with regards to their genres which shows a weak positive coorelation. 
We are able to conclude that the 3 top gross movie genre is Thrillar, war and western with them being among the top 10 popular and rated movies.
